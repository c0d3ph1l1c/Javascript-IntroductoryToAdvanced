    On IE:
    - if window is opened manually by user, window.close() will pop up a confirmation dialog box before closing the window.
    - If window is opened by window.open(), window.close() will not pop up a confimation dialog box and will close immediately.

    On Older Chrome: 
    - window.close() will close immediately regardless of whether the window is opened by window.open().

    On New Chrome & FF:
    - window.close() will only close the window immediately if the window is opened by window.open().
